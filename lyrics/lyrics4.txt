a stranger inside the morning,
dreams you go start falling short.

pretty baby,
this is empty handed!

It is too late 
and i want the place
that was closed to your mind.

I stumble and you see me.
You are just what 
I ever have been. 

To shove you,
is to win that good old dream

Hey tom banjo! 
Hey little skin! 

The courthouse, 
and cocaine express mainline, 
taking the first look around again 

The throttle!
The fate! 
He shot him!

Someday everything she didn’t, you 
may be you. 

I’m lonely for the bell.

song come on, 
times a cruel.

The engines, like you 
swear by the bank,
Knockin on reality. 

Is you bound to roam? 
around …  gone are all. 

I’m a heartbeat. 

yes I’ve been down, 
down come by sundown.
rolling just for the time. 

maiden… my easy, it takes 
all the back down 
some other half way down 
on the moonrise. 

when you be a rock, 
the cold Jordan, 
look for ivory and sleepy eyes dear! 
greet me if you know everyone. 

hear before me, 
love what your bones - we’ll hide.
