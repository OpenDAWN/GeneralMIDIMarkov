song come on, 
times a cruel.

The engines, like you 
swear by the bank,
Knockin on reality. 

Is you bound to roam? 
around …  gone are all. 

I’m a heartbeat. 

yes I’ve been down, 
down come by sundown.
rolling just for the time. 

maiden… my easy, it takes 
all the back down 
some other half way down 
on the moonrise. 

when you be a rock, 
the cold Jordan, 
look for ivory and sleepy eyes dear! 
greet me if you know everyone. 

hear before me, 
love what your bones - we’ll hide.
